    <p>It's like a bus in the sky. But you can't just get off at the next town. Some parts of flying are great, like the 
            views at times. Much of the time it is something you just want to get over and done with. 
            <br />
            <br />  
            You play roulette every time you fly with who may be sitting next to you. 
            Put the probabilities in your favor and connect and enjoy the company of others.
            Find those who share some of your interests. Or grab a seat next to those who may just 
            want to rest and appreciate a considerate and quiet seatmate.
            <br />
            <br />     
            And when you land, you go on your merry way. With a better memory
           of the flight to boot! </p>
